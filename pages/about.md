# About trnzt

This is a website made by transit and data enthusiasts. Transit is one
important part of addressing the [climate emergency][unep], and helping to explore and analyze data as it pertains to its structure and use is one way to improve our collective understanding of it.

The data presented here is the result of aggregating transit agency's [GTFS] data, identified in [The Mobility Database][mobilitydatabasecatalog]. For each transit agency listed, there's a process to download and parse the GTFS data and transform it into pages on this site.

The tools used to produce this data are all available as open source software hosted on [GitHub][github].
